# NetSolP-1.0
NetSolP-1.0 predicts the solubility and usability for purification of proteins expressed in E. coli. The usability objective includes the solubility and expressibility of proteins. NetSolP-1.0 is based on protein language models (ESM12, ESM1b).

The webserver can be found at https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?NetSolP. A standalone version of the software is available from the Downloads tab.
It contains the code for the webserver. Additionally, it also has the datasets, code for training and testing, and the trained models

## Usage

For prediction:
```
cd PredictionServer/ 
python predict.py --FASTA_PATH ./test_fasta.fasta --OUTPUT_PATH ./test_preds.csv --MODEL_TYPE ESM12 --PREDICTION_TYPE S
```
more details and requirements in the README of folder PredictionServer.

For training:
```
cd TrainAndTest/
python train.py
```
more details and requirements in the README of folder TrainAndTest.
